1.
Future warning occured
FutureWarning: In a future version, DataFrame.mean(axis=None) will return a scalar mean over the entire DataFrame. To retain the old behavior, use 'frame.mean(axis=0)' or just 'frame.mean()'

To avoid future warning, add axis = 0 to the numpy mean, min and max function
=> mean_all = np.mean(iris_stats, axis = 0)

2. 
In line 76, variable X has already been standarized and transformed in line 51. It is better to replace X in line 76 to original data(iris_stats) so that pipline can standarize the data.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)
=> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris_stats, y, random_state=42)
